- Query regressions and plan analysis
- Connection vs execution timeouts
- Copilot diagnostics and natural language troubleshooting

**Components:**
- `PPT/`: Workshop slide deck  
- `SQLScripts/`: Scripts to analyze Query Store performance and regressions  
- `PowerShell/`: Tools like `PerfAnalyzer` and `dbTestProject.ps1`  
- `PythonApp/`: Python simulation engine for generating workloads  
- `Backup/`: Azure SQL DB backup for reproducibility

## üìÅ 3. Power BI, DirectQuery & SQL Server ‚Äì Is It a Good Choice?

**Focus:** Understanding performance, bottlenecks, and best practices using DirectQuery in production environments with SQL Server (On-Prem, IaaS, MI, Azure SQL DB).

**Key Topics:**
- DirectQuery latency and CPU overhead
- Real-time vs cached model comparison
- Query folding, timeouts, and visual optimization
- Indexing and partitioning impact in Power BI

**Components:**
- `PPT/`: Comparative results between optimized and unoptimized workloads  
- `SQLScripts/`: Queries used in real dashboards with/without improvements  
- `PowerBIReports/`: PBIX examples with connected datasets  
- `DemoDB/`: Azure SQL Hyperscale demo databases (v1 and v2)
