# üß† Query Store and Azure SQL Copilot ‚Äì Who is the fairest in the land?

This hands-on workshop presented at **DataCon Seattle ‚Äì June 2025** is focused on identifying and resolving common performance issues in **Azure SQL Database** using **Query Store**, **SSMS Copilot**, and a simulated Python application.

---

## üéØ Goals

- Detect real-world performance issues: high CPU, CXPACKET, command timeouts, deadlocks, etc.
- Use **Query Data Store (QDS)** for diagnosing regressions and performance anomalies.
- Leverage **SSMS Copilot** to receive actionable insights and resolve issues faster.
- Apply best coding practices for retry logic, concurrency, and SQL efficiency.
- Promote collaboration between developers and DBAs for proactive issue resolution.

---

## üß™ Hands-On Labs

Using a Python app with simulated workloads, participants experience and troubleshoot scenarios such as:

- High CPU & CXPACKET queries  
- Execution plan regressions (parameter sniffing)  
- Command timeout vs connection timeout  
- Inefficient bulk inserts  
- High concurrency and blocking  
- Real-time diagnostics using QDS and Copilot  
- Cross-database query analysis in Elastic Pools

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Azure SQL Database** (Serverless, Gen5, 4 vCores)
- **Query Store**
- **SSMS Copilot**
- **ODBC + Python (Driver 18)**
- Simulation of bad practices and inefficiencies
- **PowerShell** scripts for bulk insert and data analysis

---

## üß© Tables Simulated

Includes specific tables to simulate:

- High CPU load
- Network latency
- Inefficient joins
- High concurrency and blocking
- Deadlocks
- `tempdb` contention

---

## üí¨ Copilot Prompt Examples

Here are some prompts used during the workshop with **SSMS Copilot**:

- `Which queries are consuming the most CPU in the last hour?`
- `Are there any missing index suggestions?`
- `Is parameter sniffing causing performance issues?`
- `Show me the execution plan for query ID 4`
- `Which queries are being canceled due to timeouts?`
